                    by law, with the express consent of the parent or guardian, or as necessary to protect the child.
                    Although local laws and customs define children differently, we consider anyone under the age of 10
                    to be a child. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child without prior
                    verifiable parental consent, we will attempt to delete the data as soon as possible.

                    product or service, for the purposes of such transfer. Such jurisdictions may have different data
                    protection laws or even no such laws. In such cases, we will we will assess the security measures
                    for data in accordance with the methods and relevant standards established by the national Internet
                    information department in conjunction with the State Council and comply with their requirements. For
                    example, we will request your consent for cross-border transfers of personal information or
                    implement security initiatives such as data de-identification prior to cross-border data transfers.
